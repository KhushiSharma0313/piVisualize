Estimating Pi with Monte Carlo Method
This project estimates the value of pi using the Monte Carlo method. By generating random points and calculating the ratio within a unit circle, we obtain an approximation of pi. The visualization showcases the estimation process with colorful lines forming the circle.

# Usage
Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies: pip install numpy matplotlib.
Run main.py to execute the estimation and visualization.
Customize the code for different parameters.
# Results
The visualization provides an intuitive representation of the pi approximation, with lines forming the circle.
